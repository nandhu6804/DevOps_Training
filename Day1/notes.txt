DOCKER
Docker is a platform that provides virtual containers on which an application can be deployed independent of the underlying OS of the server. 
Further the container can be created from a replica called docker image which contains all the dependencies and can run on any OS that has docker engine, with similar results.

VIRTUALIZATION:
Virtualization is the process of sharing hardware resources across several virtually isolated and mutually independent systems. 
It is achieved by using a hypervisor which acts as a bridge between the Operating System of each of the virtual machines and the underlying hardware.
Applications in virtual environments run on a host operating system on top of the hypervisor.

BASIC DOCKER COMMANDS
	Display docker images available in our machine
$ docker images
	Download docker image.
$ docker pull <image-name / image-id>
	Run docker image.
$ docker run <image-name / image-id>
	Delete docker image.
$ docker rmi <image-name / image-id>
	Display all running docker containers.
$ docker ps 	
	Display all running and stopped containers.
$ docker ps -a
	Delete docker container.
$ docker rm <container-id>
	Delete docker image forcefully.
$ docker rmi  -f <image-id>
	Stop Docker container.
$ docker stop <container-id>

#DOCKER COMMANDS FOR UBUNTU
$ sudo apt update -y
$ sudo apt install docker -y 
$ sudo service docker start (or) sudo systemctl start docker
$ sudo service docker enable (or) sudo systemctl enable docker

DOCKER COMPOSE
Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It simplifies the process of running multiple containers, their configurations, and their interdependencies. Compose uses a YAML file to define the services, networks, and volumes required for your application.
	Docker Compose is a tool which is used to manage multi container-based applications.
	Using Docker Compose we can easily setup & deploy multi container-based applications.
	We will give containers information to Docker Compose using YML file  (docker-compose.yml)
	Docker Compose YML should have all the information related to containers creation.
	Docker Compose YML File Looks Like:
